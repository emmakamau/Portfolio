## Description

The project is broken into:
    1.Landing section with a navigation bar,click on the link to move from one section to another. Some thing really cool to watch out for, *The intro zooms in and out and a few seconds later the avatar shows off a little*:wink:. 
    2.About Me section that talks a little about me and my tech inspiration.
    3.Project section - display of some of the websites I have built.
    4.Contact section - Links to my social accounts *reach out, let's collaborate*.

## Setup

I'd recommend having an awesome text editor and a good working knowledge of **HTML** and **CSS**
